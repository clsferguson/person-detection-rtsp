# Person Detection RTSP

Real-time multi-person detection for RTSP streams using YOLO11. The application scores the closest detected person inside a defined polygon from 0 (polygon boundary) to 1000 (target point) and exposes the results through an interactive web dashboard.

## Features

- üöÄ **YOLO11 detection pipeline** tuned for person-class inference.
- üõ°Ô∏è **RTSP pre-flight connectivity checks** prevent UI stalls when the camera is offline and display an informative placeholder instead.
- üéØ **Interactive detection zone editor** directly on the main page:
  - Toggle edit mode to draw/reshape the polygonal target zone.
  - Right-click edges to add vertices, drag existing vertices to reposition them.
  - Drag the target point marker to redefine the priority location.
- üíæ **Config persistence** to `config/config.json`, editable both through the UI and a JSON API.
- üìà **Proximity scoring** (0‚Äì1000) reported on the live stream overlay for the person closest to your target point while inside the polygon.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure Docker (and NVIDIA Docker if you intend to leverage GPUs) is installed on your host machine.
3. Build and start the stack:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
4. Browse to <http://localhost:5000> to access the dashboard.

> **Tip:** The default configuration creates a simple rectangular detection zone. You can reshape it as soon as the UI loads‚Äîeven if no RTSP stream is currently reachable.

## Using the Web UI

1. **Live Feed** ‚Äì The left panel renders the MJPEG stream. When the stream is offline you will see a status frame instead of a frozen UI.
2. **Edit Mode** ‚Äì Click **Enable Edit Mode** to overlay the polygon controls.
   - Drag polygon vertices (red handles) to reshape the detection zone.
   - Right-click along polygon edges to insert new vertices on the fly.
   - Drag the green marker to update the target proximity point.
   - Click **Reset Geometry** while in edit mode to start from a centered rectangle.
3. **Configuration Form** ‚Äì The right panel mirrors the current RTSP URL, max distance, polygon, and target point.
   - Adjust the RTSP URL or maximum distance as needed.
   - Save your changes to persist them to disk and apply immediately.
4. **Persistence** ‚Äì Settings are written to `config/config.json`. They will be reloaded automatically on the next startup.
